=============

Integration Tests for OpenTransactions

This repo contains currently two spikes for integration testing OT. One for Pyhton the other for Go.

The directory `clean_server_state` contains the result of running:

```
$ opentxs/scripts/install_sample_data.sh
```

This is to be copied to the `~/.ot` directory prior to starting the OT server (`opentxs-server`).
